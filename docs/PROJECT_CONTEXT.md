# PROJECT_CONTEXT.md

## Project Name
**FocusTime Now**

## Vision
A lightweight iPhone app that helps people stay disciplined and focused by making time usage visible, easy to track, and aligned with goals.  
Core idea: *"Stay aware of what you're doing, right now."*

## Current Stage
(Example)  
- Following **Stage 1 (MVP)** of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.  
- Core features: ActivityEvent model, timeline view, quick Start/Stop, daily totals.  
- Next step: build Timeline UI and persistence with SwiftData.

## Key Documents
- **SPEC.md** → Product specification (vision, problems, solutions, models, principles).  
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** → Development plan by stages (MVP → advanced features).  
- **USER_FLOWS.md** → User flows (Quick Mode, Detailed Mode, example scenarios).  
- **UI_DESIGN.md** (optional) → Wireframes or layout notes.  

## Development Principles
- Keep input simple (Quick Mode default, Detailed optional).  
- Make wasted time visible.  
- Provide awareness and a sense of achievement (charts, streaks, badges).  
- Favor lightweight logging over heavy data entry.  

## Notes for AI Assistants
- Always refer to SPEC.md for product scope.  
- Follow IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for development sequence.  
- Use USER_FLOWS.md for UI/UX decisions.  
- Keep code implementation in Swift (SwiftUI + SwiftData).
